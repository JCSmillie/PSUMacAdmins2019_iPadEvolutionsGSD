# PSUMacAdmins2019_iPadEvolutionsGSD
This branch is dedicated to my Penn State MacAdmins 2019 presentation titled *iPad Evolution at Gateway School District* presented on July 12th, 2019.  It will include any scripts I mention during my presentation which I can release as well as slides from that presentation.  Presentation will be recorded so I will also add a link to it when its available.

Questions?  I can be reached here:
* Email-> jsmillie@gatewayk12.org

* Reddit-> u/MyAppropriateAcct


Thanks!
